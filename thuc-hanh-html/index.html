    <h1>Accelerated Learning: Learn Faster and Remember More</h1>
    <div>
        <p>You can train your brain to retain knowledge and insight better by understanding how you learn. Once you
            understand the keys to learning, everything changes—from the way you ask questions to the way you consume
            information. People will think you have a superpower.</p>
        <img src="https://149366099.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2u-goMSw-300x300.jpeg">
        <p>Learning is the act of incorporating new facts, concepts, and abilities into our brains. We start learning in
            the womb and we never stop; we are always developing new competencies. Every new bit of knowledge we acquire
            builds on what we already know and gives us a fuller, richer picture of the world. And the more developed
            our understanding of the world is, the easier it is for us to adapt and pivot when our circumstances change.
        </p>
        <p>We know from biology that organisms that can adapt to their constantly changing environment survive and
            thrive. Those that can’t eventually go extinct. The same is true for us in our life and work. We all know
            the person at work that hasn’t adapted to the changing times. Their unwillingness to stretch themselves and
            learn something new makes it seem like they are moving backwards.</p>
        <p>People can end up stuck with a static amount of knowledge because we don’t just passively absorb new ideas
            and information. Learning something new requires active engagement. At FS, we see learning as part of our
            daily job. We get better to help you get better, and we give you the tools to learn.</p>
        <p>The greatest enemy of learning is what you think you know. When you think you know something, learning
            something new means you might have to change your mind, so it’s easy to think there’s no room for new ideas.
            But not wanting to change your mind will keep you stuck in the same place. Overcoming our egos can be one of
            the big challenges of learning. Therefore, being willing to admit when you’re wrong and adjust your thinking
            is the thing that will help you learn the most. The first step to learning is recognizing your ignorance and
            deciding to do something about it.</p>
        <p>At FS, we believe that thriving in life means relentless lifelong learning. Things change quickly, and you
            can’t coast on what you already know. The best approach you can take towards learning is one that helps you
            go to bed a little bit smarter each day.</p>

    <h2>TWO MAIN SOURCES OF LEARNING</h2>
    <div>
        <p>There are two main places we can learn from: our own experience and history, or the experience of others.
            Exploring the distinction between the two can show us the best ways to learn from each of them.</p>
        <img src="https://149366099.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/eRXJvWlA-300x300.jpeg">
        <h3>Learning from history</h3>
        <p>You can learn from the experiences of others by studying history and applying its lessons to the present.
            History tends to repeat itself, so the dilemmas and decisions you face today often have historical
            antecedents. Studying the past helps us know how to shape the future. History is one of our biggest sources
            of fundamental knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>Any time you learn from the past, remember that knowledge collapses over time. Much of what you know today
            will one day prove false, just like much of what people knew a century, fifty years, or even a decade ago
            has since proved false. Facts have a half-life, one that can be especially short in fields like medicine and
            the social sciences.</p>
        <p>It is a mistake to think we have reached the endpoint of human knowledge, or that anything you learn now will
            be true forever. When you learn from history, you draw from lessons shaped by the perspective of the person
            who captured what happened. Thus, historical knowledge is something to continuously update as you learn both
            from what happened and how you choose to look at it.</p>
        <h3>Learning from experience and reflection</h3>
        <p>In addition to reading, direct experience is the other main way we learn.</p>
        <p>Double loop learning is a way of updating your opinions and ideas in response to new evidence and experience.
            When you keep repeating the same mistakes, you’re using single loop learning. It doesn’t get you far. When
            you reflect on experiences, collect new data, and make an active effort to seek out feedback, you’re using
            double loop learning.</p>
        <p>Reflection allows you to distill experience into learning. Don’t just “do,” think about what you’re doing and
            what you’ve done. High performers make adjustments based on both their successes and failures.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>LEARN BETTER</h2>
    <div>
        <p>We recommend the following two proven techniques for improving your learning.</p>
        <h3>The Feynman Technique</h3>
        <p>If you want to supercharge your learning, the single most effective technique we’ve uncovered for absorbing
            new concepts comes from the famed Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. The Feynman Technique
            ensures you understand what you learn. It includes the following four steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose a concept you wish to learn about.</li>
            <li>Pretend you are teaching it to a child—a sixth-grader, specifically. Write your explanation down or say
                it out loud.</li>
            <li>Identify any gaps in your understanding that might show up when you try to simplify the concept; go back
                to the source material to find the information you need.</li>
            <li>Review and simplify your explanation again.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Spaced repetition</h3>
        <p>Rote memorization doesn’t work. Period. The key to effective learning is spaced repetition, a technique that
            works with the way your brain naturally retains information, not against it.</p>
        <p>Spaced repetition involves revising information at increasing intervals. This reflects and combats the fact
            that once you learn something you gradually forget it, with the forgetting happening fast at first, then
            leveling off. Using spaced repetition, you remind yourself of information often at first, then less often.
        </p>
        <p>Memory mastery comes from repeated exposure to new material. In order to learn something, you need to
            retrieve it from memory again and again. Retrieval makes information stick even better than re-exposing
            yourself to the original material.</p>

    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Learning isn’t something you do at the behest of someone else. You’re responsible for it. According to the
            prolific author Louis L’Amour, all education is self-education. If you don’t take charge of your learning,
            no one else will. Maya Angelou and George Washington took the same view. It’s up to you to build the habit
            of lifelong learning.</p>
